## Learning Objectives
- Understand the theory behind gradient descent optimization
- Implement gradient descent from scratch
- Apply different variants of gradient descent (batch, stochastic, mini-batch)
- Understand polynomial regression and feature engineering
- Handle overfitting in polynomial models
- Visualize optimization landscapes and convergence

## Getting Started
1. Start with `L03_Gradient_Descent.ipynb` to learn gradient descent fundamentals
2. Practice with the hands-on exercises in the main notebook
3. Explore additional examples in `Week3_PolyReg_and_Gradient_Descent.ipynb` (voluntary)
