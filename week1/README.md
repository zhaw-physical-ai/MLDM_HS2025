# Week 1: Data Cleaning, Regression, and Classification

## Overview
This week introduces fundamental concepts in data preprocessing and basic machine learning models.

## Files

- **L01_Data_Cleaning.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook covering data cleaning techniques including handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation
- **lab01_dirty_data.csv**: Raw dataset with quality issues for cleaning exercises
- **lab01_clean_data.csv**: Cleaned version of the dataset for comparison
- **Week1 regression and classification Students data SEP.ipynb**: Introduction to regression and classification algorithms

## Learning Objectives
- Identify and handle missing data
- Detect and treat outliers
- Apply data normalization techniques
- Implement basic regression models
- Build simple classification models

## Getting Started
1. Start with `L01_Data_Cleaning.ipynb` to learn data preprocessing
2. Use `lab01_dirty_data.csv` for hands-on practice
3. Compare your results with `lab01_clean_data.csv` (or use it if you cannot reach the same result)
4. Proceed to the regression and classification notebook for some examples (voluntary)
