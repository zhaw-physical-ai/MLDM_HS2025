# Week 4: Logistic Regression

## Overview
This week focuses on logistic regression for binary classification problems and understanding the bias-variance tradeoff.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the theory behind logistic regression
- Implement logistic regression from scratch
- Apply logistic regression using scikit-learn
- Understand the sigmoid function and decision boundaries
- Evaluate classification model performance using appropriate metrics
- Handle binary classification problems
- Understand the bias-variance tradeoff
- Analyze model complexity and its impact on performance

## Getting Started
1. Start with `L04_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` to learn logistic regression fundamentals
2. Practice with the hands-on exercises in the main notebook
3. Explore additional examples in `Week 4 - Logistic regression.ipynb` (voluntary)
4. Explore bias-variance concepts in `Week 4 - Model complexity bias-variance.ipynb` (voluntary)
