# Week 8: Support Vector Machines

## Overview
This week focuses on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a powerful supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. You'll learn about kernels, margin maximization, and practical applications of SVMs.

## Files

- **L08_SVMs.ipynb**: Main lab notebook covering SVM concepts and implementation
- **Extra_SVM_material.ipynb**: Additional examples and advanced SVM topics (optional)

## Open directly the lab in Google Colab

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of maximum margin classifiers
- Learn about support vectors and their role in SVMs
- Master kernel methods and the kernel trick
- Implement SVMs for linear and non-linear classification
- Apply SVMs to real-world datasets
- Tune SVM hyperparameters (C, gamma, kernel types)
- Compare SVMs with other classification algorithms

## Getting Started
1. Start with `L08_SVMs.ipynb` to learn SVM fundamentals
2. Practice with the hands-on exercises in the main notebook
3. Explore additional examples in `Extra_SVM_material.ipynb` (voluntary)
