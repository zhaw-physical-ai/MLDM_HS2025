## Learning Objectives
- Understand the theory behind linear regression
- Implement linear regression from scratch
- Apply linear regression using scikit-learn
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Handle overfitting and underfitting in linear models

## Getting Started
1. Start with `L02_Linear_Regression.ipynb` to learn linear regression fundamentals
2. Practice with the hands-on exercises in the main notebook
3. Explore additional examples in `week2_examples_linear_regression.ipynb` (voluntary)
