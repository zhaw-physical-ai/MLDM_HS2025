# Week 11: Clustering

## Overview
This week focuses on Clustering, one of the most important unsupervised learning techniques. You'll learn about different clustering algorithms, how to identify patterns in unlabeled data, and how to evaluate clustering performance. Topics include K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and methods for choosing the optimal number of clusters.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and clustering
- Learn and implement K-means clustering algorithm
- Master hierarchical clustering methods (agglomerative and divisive)
- Understand density-based clustering with DBSCAN
- Apply the elbow method and silhouette analysis to determine optimal cluster count
- Evaluate clustering quality using various metrics
- Handle different data types and distance metrics
- Compare different clustering algorithms and their use cases
- Visualize high-dimensional clustering results

## Getting Started
1. Start with `L11_Clustering.ipynb` to learn clustering fundamentals
2. Practice with the hands-on exercises in the main notebook
3. Explore `Extra_Clustering.ipynb` for advanced techniques and real-world applications
