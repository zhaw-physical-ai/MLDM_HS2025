Optimal Threshold Selection (2 points)\n","Probabilistic classifiers such as logistic regression output a real number between 0 and 1, which expresses how certain/confident the model is that the input example belongs to the positive class. However, to make a final (binary) classification decision, we have to apply some threshold to this number. Oftentimes, 0.5 is taken as the threshold, which is intuitive since it is halfway between 0 and 1. However, this value is actually arbitrary.\n","\n","A more sensible way of picking the threshold is based on the **cost** involved in making different kinds of mistakes. In binary decision problems, there can be false positives (mistakenly classifying a negative example as a positive) and false negatives (mistakenly classifying a positive example as a negative). These two kinds of mistakes may have different real-world costs associated with them. For instance, in a machine learning setting in which a credit card company wants to predict whether a customer will enter \"default\"/bankruptcy and wants to automatically \"warn\" the customer not to forget their payment, the costs could be:\n","- False positive: Telling a customer you are concerned they might not pay their bill, even though they always do, can be insulting. It could cause them to move their business elsewhere.\n","- False negative: Not telling a customer you are concerned even though they will forget to pay a bill can result in lost revenue for the company.\n","\n","Based on the relative magnitude of these costs, it may be more important to keep the number of false positives low at the expense of accruing more false negatives; or the reverse might be true.\n","\n","With this in mind, this task will explore how to calculate an optimal threshold automatically, given a pre-defined cost configuration of false positives and false negatives.\n","\n","### Dataset:\n","In this task we will work with the **Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset**.
