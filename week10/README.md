# Week 10: Generative Models

## Overview
This week focuses on Generative Models and probabilistic approaches to machine learning. You'll learn about Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, and Naive Bayes classifiers, gaining insight into how probabilistic models can be used for classification and inference.
